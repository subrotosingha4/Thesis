# Mindwandering Detection

Project to use data reported in these two papers:

- Bixler, R., & D’Mello, S. (2015). Automatic gaze-based detection of mind wandering with 
  metacognitive awareness. In International conference on user modeling, adaptation,
  and personalization (Vol. 9146, pp. 31–43). Springer, Cham. Retrieved

- Faber, M., Bixler, R., & D’Mello, S. K. (2018). An automated behavioral measure of mind
  wandering during computerized reading. Behavior Research Methods, 50(1), 134-150.
  
In particular we are most closely following the second 2018 paper.  This project seeks to replicate the findings
reported in that paper, but using Python ML libraries (scikit-learn for general ML, keras for neural networks and
deep learning).  And if the findings replicate, the ultimate goal is to see if we can improve the model using
neural networks, deep learning and possibly recurrent network predictor models.
